The Hanzo Python SDK provides a unified interface to 100+ LLM providers through a single OpenAI-compatible API. It includes enterprise features like cost tracking, rate limiting, and observability.

## Features

- **100+ LLM Providers**: Access OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and more through a single API
- **OpenAI Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for the OpenAI SDK
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built-in cost tracking, rate limiting, and team management

## Packages

The SDK is organized as a monorepo with multiple packages:

| Package | Description |

| `hanzoai` | Core SDK for Hanzo AI platform |
| `hanzo-mcp` | Model Context Protocol implementation |
| `hanzo-agents` | Agent framework and swarm orchestration |
| `hanzo-memory` | Memory and knowledge base management |
| `hanzo` | CLI and orchestration tools |

## Quick Example

```python
from hanzoai import Hanzo

client = Hanzo(api_key="your-api-key")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```
