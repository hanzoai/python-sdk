This tool rolls a 64-path Zen oracle and selects relevant Hanzo principles
to provide creative, actionable guidance for your engineering challenge.

Parameters:
- challenge: Description of the engineering challenge or question

The oracle will:
1. Roll one of 64 Zen philosophies for the current situation
2. Select relevant Hanzo principles
3. Synthesize actionable guidance
4. Provide specific recommendations

Example:
zen(
    challenge="How should I approach refactoring this legacy codebase?"
)

Use this when you need:
- Fresh perspective on a problem
- Creative approach to challenges
- Wisdom for difficult decisions
- Alignment with Hanzo principles"""
